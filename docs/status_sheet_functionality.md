# Status Sheet Functionality in ETL Dashboard

## Overview

The Status sheet is a critical component of the ETL Dashboard that provides project completion tracking and plant-level performance monitoring. It transforms project status data into normalized, analytical-ready tables for Power BI reporting.

## What the Status Sheet Contains

The Status sheet typically contains:

1. **Project Information**
   - Project names (often containing plant identifiers)
   - OEM/Customer information
   - Overall project status

2. **Completion Metrics**
   - Overall completion percentages
   - PSW (Part Submission Warrant) completion
   - Drawing completion percentages
   - PPAP (Production Part Approval Process) completion

3. **Timeline Information**
   - Milestone dates
   - Target completion dates
   - Status update timestamps

4. **Plant-Specific Data**
   - Plant identifiers embedded in project names
   - Plant-specific completion rates
   - Facility-level performance metrics

## ETL Processing Steps

### Step 1: Header Cleaning
- Standardizes column names
- Removes special characters and spaces
- Ensures consistent naming conventions

### Step 2: Text Standardization
- Normalizes text values across columns
- Handles case sensitivity issues
- Cleans up inconsistent data entry

### Step 3: Percentage Conversion
- Converts percentage strings to numeric values
- Handles various percentage formats (e.g., "85%", "0.85", "85")
- Ensures consistent decimal representation (0.0-1.0)

### Step 4: Project Name Cleaning
- Extracts meaningful project identifiers
- Removes extraneous characters
- Standardizes project naming conventions

### Step 5: Empty Row Removal
- Identifies and removes completely empty rows
- Preserves rows with partial data
- Maintains data integrity

### Step 6: Project Completion Extraction
- **Most Important Step**: Creates the `project_completion_by_plant` table
- Extracts plant-level completion data from project information
- Normalizes data for analytical processing

## Key Output: project_completion_by_plant Table

This table is the primary analytical output from Status sheet processing:

### Table Structure
```
project_name              | string  | Project identifier
oem                      | string  | OEM/Customer name
plant_id                 | string  | Plant identifier (e.g., "YMOK", "YRL")
plant_name               | string  | Plant name (e.g., "Plant_YMOK")
overall_completion_pct   | float   | Overall completion (0.0-1.0)
psw_completion_pct       | float   | PSW completion (0.0-1.0)
drawing_completion_pct   | float   | Drawing completion (0.0-1.0)
ppap_completion_pct      | float   | PPAP completion (0.0-1.0)
completion_status        | string  | Text status ("Complete", "In Progress", etc.)
milestone_date           | date    | Key milestone date
total_parts              | int     | Total number of parts in project
```

### Plant Extraction Logic

The system uses intelligent pattern matching to extract plant information:

1. **Regex Patterns**: Identifies plant codes in project names
   - Pattern: `r'([A-Z]{2,4})'` for plant codes like "YMOK", "YRL"
   - Handles various naming conventions

2. **Plant Name Generation**: Creates standardized plant names
   - Format: "Plant_{plant_id}"
   - Example: "YMOK" → "Plant_YMOK"

3. **Multi-Plant Projects**: Handles projects spanning multiple plants
   - Creates separate records for each plant
   - Maintains project-plant relationships

### Completion Status Determination

The system automatically determines completion status based on metrics:

- **Complete**: Overall completion ≥ 95%
- **Near Complete**: Overall completion ≥ 80%
- **In Progress**: Overall completion ≥ 20%
- **Not Started**: Overall completion < 20%
- **On Hold**: Special status indicators present

## Integration with Power BI Data Model

### Relationships

The `project_completion_by_plant` table integrates with other tables:

1. **MasterBOM Integration**
   - Links projects to specific parts
   - Enables part-level completion tracking
   - Supports plant-specific part analysis

2. **Plant Dimension**
   - Creates plant hierarchy for reporting
   - Enables cross-plant comparisons
   - Supports regional analysis

3. **Date Dimension**
   - Links milestone dates to calendar
   - Enables time-based analysis
   - Supports trend reporting

### Enhanced DAX Measures

The Status sheet data enables powerful analytical measures:

#### Project Completion Metrics
- `Average Project Completion %`: Overall completion across all projects
- `Projects Complete Count`: Number of fully completed projects
- `Projects In Progress Count`: Active project count

#### Plant Performance Metrics
- `Plant Completion Average`: Average completion by plant
- `Best Performing Plant`: Highest completion rate
- `Worst Performing Plant`: Lowest completion rate

#### Cross-Plant Analysis
- `Plant Completion Variance`: Completion rate spread across plants
- `Plants Above Average`: Count of high-performing plants
- `Plants Below Average`: Count of underperforming plants

#### Time-Based Tracking
- `Overdue Milestones`: Projects past milestone dates
- `Upcoming Milestones (30 Days)`: Near-term deadlines
- `Completion Trend (MoM)`: Month-over-month progress

## Business Value

### Project Management
- **Real-time visibility** into project completion status
- **Plant-level performance** tracking and comparison
- **Milestone monitoring** and deadline management

### Operational Excellence
- **Bottleneck identification** across plants and processes
- **Resource allocation** optimization based on completion rates
- **Performance benchmarking** between facilities

### Strategic Planning
- **Capacity planning** based on completion trends
- **Investment decisions** informed by plant performance
- **Risk management** through early warning indicators

## Data Quality Features

### Validation and Verification
- **Completion percentage validation**: Ensures values are within 0-100%
- **Date validation**: Verifies milestone dates are reasonable
- **Plant code validation**: Confirms plant identifiers are valid

### Error Handling
- **Graceful degradation**: Continues processing with partial data
- **Detailed logging**: Tracks all processing steps and issues
- **Data preservation**: Maintains original data alongside processed results

### Audit Trail
- **Processing timestamps**: Records when data was processed
- **Transformation log**: Details all applied business rules
- **Quality metrics**: Tracks data completeness and accuracy

This comprehensive Status sheet processing transforms raw project data into actionable business intelligence, enabling data-driven decision making across the organization.
